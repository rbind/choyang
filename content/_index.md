## About

R programming enthusiast and skillful in R package development, documentation and implementation. Research mainly on bioinformatics, next generataion Sequencing data analysis, microbiology and metagenomics. Independent, Good team cooperation ability, With strong desire to experience new technologies. Willing to accept challenge and enable to withstand pressure.

This website was build with the [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and the theme is [hatw](https://github.com/yiluheihei/hugo-hatw) framework, a simple personalized theme, and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The source code of my website is at [https://github.com/rbind/choyang](https://github.com/rbind/choyang).


## Education

- PhD in Bioinformatics, Beijing Institure of Radiation and Medicine, 2015
- Bachelor of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, 2009

## Project and Code 

- [RevEcoR](https://github.com/yiluheihei/RevEcoR), an R package implementations the reverse ecology framework, which allows researchers to reconstruct the metabolic networks and study the ecology of poorly characterized microbial species from their genomic information.

- [shiny-RevEcoR](https://github.com/yiluheihei/shiny-RevEcoR), an interactive web application that provides a flexible graphical user interface (GUI) to the Reverse Ecology analysis package for R.

- [NFP](https://github.com/yiluheihei/NFP), an R package making systematic comparisons to a set of well-studied "basic networks", measuring both the functional and topological similarity
